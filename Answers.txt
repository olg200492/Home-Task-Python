1. What is the difference between os.environ and os.getenv ?
os.environ dictionary contains all the environment variables.
os.environ[] raises an exception if the environmental variable does not exist
vs. os.getenv() Python also provides to access environment variables does not raise an exception, but returns None
2.What is the difference between json.dumps and json.dump?
The json.dump() method used to write Python serialized object as JSON formatted data into a file
and the json.dumps() method encodes any Python object into JSON formatted String.
3. Why would this not work in python 2 and will work in python3?
f = lambda x:print(x)
A lambda's body has to be a single expression. In Python 2.x, print is a statement. However, in Python 3, print is a function (and a function application is an expression, so it will work in a lambda).
4. What is the difference in the implementaion between python 2 and python 3 of
this code?
for i in range(10):
    pass
In Python 2 this code creates a list from number 0 to 9,and then iterates on this list.
In Python 3 range(10) uses the generator to produce numbers. It doesnâ€™t generate all numbers at once.
It generates the next value only when for loop iteration asked for it. In each loop iteration, It generates the next value and assigns it to the iterator variable i.
5.
import os
os.system("cat file.txt")
pure python
file = open("file.txt", "r").read()
print (file)
